# circuit-playground-christmas-tree

My circuit python code used in the project [Circuit Playground Christmas Tree](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-christmas-tree/software). Originally created this project using the code from the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit Pumpkin with Lights and Sounds](https://learn.adafruit.com/pumpkin-with-circuit-playground-bluefruit) project. Both projects are by the Ruiz Brothers for Adafruit. 

I just started modifying it and adding animations of my own. Still needs to add parts that utilize the bluetooth stuff, but the color picker should work for now.

## Todo:

- Perform actions using Bluefruit controller buttons
